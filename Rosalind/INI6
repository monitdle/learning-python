# INI 6
## Initial idea
```
s = "When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me"
list = []
dict = {}
for word in s.split(" "):
    if word not in list:
        list.append(word)
        dict[word] = 1
    else:
        dict[word] += 1

for key, value in dict.items():
    print(key, value)
```
- I think I thought of this bc I'm more familiar working with lists than dictionaries
- I did use the hints


## Clean up
```
s = "We tried list and we tried dicts also we tried Zen"
dict = {}
for word in s.split(" "):
    if word not in dict:
        dict[word] = 1
    else:
        dict[word] += 1

for key, value in dict.items():
    print(key, value)
```
